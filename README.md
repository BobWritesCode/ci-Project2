## Objective 

Random Result Generator is a site to help the end user be able to run a raffle type giveaway or just to help make a choice. The site has a range of multiple targets including companies looking to provide a virtual giveaway live, all the way to someone who just wants to make a decision on what takeaway they are having that evening. The site has a lot of potential to go further from where it currently is and this is mentioned in the [Features Left to Implement](#Features-Left-to-Implement) of this README.

***
## Brief

My goals for the site are to have:
- a generator that provides random results based on the user's input.
- a way for the user to input their own potential results.
- a way for the user to customise how many results they get from the generator.
- a way for the user to customise the generator to fit their own brand.
- a way for the user to easily modify thier choices.

## Features
Random Result Generator is filled with features for the end user and there is a lot of stuff also happening in the background. In this section we will breakddown  the different features and what is happening in the background.

### Existing Features

#### Desktop and Mobile viewing

It was important to make sure that this site worked across mobile and desktop. Using Flex and a combination of viewport typography the site displays very well across different screensizes.

#### User options

![User options - Part 1](/assets/images/readme/options_1.webp)\
**"Edit options and how they appear:"**\
The first section is designed for the user to input their potential outcomes and some basic options on how the results will output.

  - **"Enter potential results for Random Result Regenerator"**\
  In this section the user can input their own options to what they wish to get random results for. For the ease of testing I have provided some sample options as an example. The user just needs to make sure each option is separted with a comma and the last option on the list does not end in a comma.

  - **"How many final results:"**\
  User can decide how many results will appear. Using CSS and JS I have made sure that the generator scales the divs and font size appropriately.

  - **"How long each result randomises before showing final result:"**\
  User can decide how long between each result until the next one is shown. As default it is set to 2 seconds.

  - **"Can an option win multiple times:"**\
  User can decide if options from their list can appear multiple times in the same random generated results.

  - **"Edit your text you wish to deiplay:"**\
  This section is more dedicated to user text input for the Generator, what they want to see as the Title, the text they want to display in the center before starting the randomising and the tail text at the bottom of the screen.

  - **Preset template select**\
  ![Preset template select](/assets/images/readme/preset.gif)\
  The user can choose from currently 1 or 3 preset color templates. Using CSS and JS there is onscreen feedback to the user by a green border apeparing around the selected option.

  - **User colour picker**\
  ![User colour picker](/assets/images/readme/colour-picker.gif)\
  The user can decided what colour scheme they wish to have for the generator. This can be very helpful if the user wants to keep it on brand. 

  - **User background picker**\
  ![User colour picker](/assets/images/readme/background-picker.gif)\
  The user can pick either a solid colour background, which they can use the color picker to choose. This is useful if the user wants to display results on a livestream and have a transparant background using chroma key[^1]. Or there are some patterend backgrounds created using CSS (Credit to [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/)).

  - **Optional fullscreen**\
  ![Optional fullscreen](/assets/images/readme/user-fullscreen.webp)\
  The user has the option to open the generator fullscreen. This could be useful if the results are being revealed in person and the results are being shown on a big screen to an audience of people.

  - **Button - Load the generator**\
  ![Button - Load the generator](/assets/images/readme/button-load.webp)\
  This button will run the JS function loadGenerator().

  - **Footer**\
  ![Button - Load the generator](/assets/images/readme/footer.webp)\
  The footer is just to help the user experience and let them know they have reach the bottom of the page.

  - Tested with 5000 entries

### Features Left to Implement

***
## Technologies Used

***
## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

***
## Bugs
### Unfixed
### Resolved

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

***
## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
